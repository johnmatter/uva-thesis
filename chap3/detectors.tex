\section{Detector Packages}
The detector stacks in both spectrometers consist of a lead glass calorimeter,
one or more Cherenkov counters, a hodoscope, and a pair of drift chambers.

\subsection{Threshold Cherenkov Counters}
Threshold Cherenkov counters make use of a particle-dependent Cherenkov
radiation threshold to discriminate between types of particles.
A charged particle with mass $m$, velocity $\beta$, and 3-momentum $p$ passing
through a medium with index of refraction $n$ will emit Cherenkov radiation if
\begin{equation}
    \frac{c}{n} < \beta = \frac{p}{\sqrt{p^2+m^2}}
\end{equation}
or equivalently, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:hms_cer_threshold},
\begin{equation}
    1-\frac{c}{n} > 1-\beta = 1-\frac{p}{\sqrt{p^2+m^2}}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

Over a sufficiently narrow range of momenta, only some types of particles will
emit Cherenkov radiation.
For example, for a threshold Chereknov counter filled with \ch{C4F8O} at
0.45 atm, the presence or absence of Cherenkov radiation can be used to
determine if the particle that generated a trigger is an electron or a hadron,
provided the momentum range in question is below $\sim$4 \si{\giga\eV}.
Given knowledge of the expected range of momenta an experiment requires and
what types of backgrounds will need to be removed, one can pick an appropriate
Cherenkov medium based on its index of refraction. Further tuning of the
threshold can be done by adjusting the pressure of the gas, making use of
the fact that pressure is proportional to $n-1$.

            will produce Cherenkov radiation.

Suppose a threshold Cherenkov detector has
light-gathering efficiency $\epsilon_c(\lambda)$,
a PMT with quantum efficiency $QE(\lambda)$,
and is filled with a gas with transparency $G(\lambda)$
and index of refraction $n$.
It can be shown\cite{NGC_Design_Report} that by a particle of charge $e$ passing through the detector
with velocity $\beta$ and path length $L$ will generate
$N_e =AL\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta^2n^2}\right)$ photoelectrons, where
\begin{equation}
A = 2 \pi \alpha \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} \epsilon_c(\lambda)QE(\lambda)G(\lambda)\frac{d\lambda}{\lambda^2}.
\end{equation}

The gas Cherenkov detectors in the HMS and SHMS use spherical mirrors to focus
Cherenkov radiation onto PMTs mounted on the back of the detector. The SHMS
aerogel Cherenkov consists of an aeorogel tray, covered in either GORE or
Millipore diffusion materials\cite{Horn_2017}, mounted between two columns
of PMTs.

\subsection{Calorimeters}
A lead glass calorimeter provides another means for discriminating between
electrons and hadrons.
The calorimeters in both spectrometers consist of lead blocks with
PMTs attached that collect light generated by electromagnetic showers.
The electric field of the nuclei in the block will slow down a high energy
electron passing through the block.
The electron will radiate Bremsstrahlung photons, which will in turn generate
positron-electron pairs that will also radiate photons, and so on.
The resulting electromagnetic shower of photons, electrons, and positrons
generates Cherenkov radiation that is collected by PMTs mounted on the ends
of the lead glass blocks.
The amount of light collected is proportional to the deposited energy.
Electrons, positrons, and photons will deposit all of their energy.
For the kinematics of E12-06-102, this is between 2 and 6 GeV.
These particles will produce a peak centered around 1 in the distribution of
the track-normalized energy deposition, $E/p$.
A pion, whose mass is much greater than an electron's, will typically deposit
about 300 MeV.
A negative pion undergoing a charge-exchange reaction in the bulk of the
calorimeter can produce a neutral pion which will decay into two photons,
resulting in a significant fraction of energy being deposited.
As a result, there is a large pion tail in the $E/p$ distribution that extends
up to 1.
Heavier hadrons typically deposit no energy.

\subsubsection{HMS Calorimeter}
The HMS calorimeter\cite{Mkrtchyan_2012} consists of four rows of thirteen
10x10x70 \si{\cm\cubed} lead glass blocks.
The total thickness is $\sim$14.6 radiation lengths.
The blocks are made of TF-1 type lead glass with an index of refraction of
1.65, radiation length 2.74 \si{cm}, and density 3.86 \si{\gram\per\cm\cubed}..
Each block is wrapped in 25 \si{\um} thick aluminized Mylar and 40
\si{\um} thick Tedlar type film to block external light.
The light generated in each block is collected by two Phillips XP3462B PMTs,
one on each end.

\subsubsection{SHMS Calorimeter}
The SHMS calorimeter consists of a preshower and shower section.
The preshower radiator consists of one layer of 28 TF-1 type lead glass blocks,
identical to the HMS blocks, stacked in two columns of 14 blocks.
The ``fly eye'' shower array consists of 224 modules from the decommissioned
HERMES detector\cite{Avakian_1998} stacked in 14 columns and 16 rows.
The HERMES blocks are i8.9x8.9x50 \si{\cm\cubed} blocks of F-101 type lead glass with
an index of refraction of 1.65, radiation length 2.78 \si{\cm}, and density
3.86 \si{\gram\per\cm\cubed}.
Each preshower block is read out by one Phillips XP3462B PMT, and each shower
block by one Photonis XP3461 PMT.
