\section{Charge-normalized Yield}
Experimental yields for each kinematic settic were corrected using
kinematic-specific trigger efficiencies, PID efficiencies, tracking
efficiencies, and electronic livetimes.
Due to limited statistics, the same proton absorption correction calculated
using $Q^2=\SI{11.5}{\giga\electronvolt}$ was used for all kinematics.
The same LH2 boiling correction is used for all runs.
