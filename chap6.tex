\chapter{Summary and Conclusion}
Using the upgraded 12\,\,GeV CEBAF beam at JLab, coincidence $(e,e'p)$ data
were taken with $^{1}H$ and $^{12}C$ targets for $Q^2$ values between 8 and
14.2\,(GeV/$c)^2$.
Nuclear transparencies were extracted for each kinematic point by integrating
charge-normalized yields and taking their ratio.
The transparency measured at the lowest kinematic point at
$Q^2=8.1$\,(GeV/$c)^2$ agrees with prior measurements at JLab.
The $Q^2$-dependence of the measured transparencies is consistent with
traditional Glauber multiple scattering theory and does not show an onset of
color transparency in $^{12}C(e,e'p)$ below $Q^2=14.2$\,(GeV/$c)^2$.
Though other work has suggested that the onset may be more obvious in the
$s$-shell than in the $p$-shell, this effect is not evident in this
experiment's results.

Experiments at JLab in the near future will include color transparency studies
in rho (Hall B) and pion (Hall C) electroproduction, and pion photoproduction
in Hall D.
