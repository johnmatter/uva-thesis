            The results of this experiment, E12-06-107, are shown in red along
            with previous measurements in open shapes.
            The error bars represent statistical uncertainty and the
            shaded band represents the 4.0\% systematic uncertainty.
            The magenta line is the prediction of a Glauber
            model that does not include CT~\cite{Pandharipande_1992}.
            The dashed lines represent predictions, for two choices of
            parameters, of a model including CT~\cite{Frankfurt_1995_PRC}.
            The solid line represents the prediction of a relativistic Glauber
            model that includes CT~\cite{Cosyn_2006}.

\subsection{Statistical Uncertainty}

\subsection{Systematic Uncertainty}

Table~\ref{tab:systematic_uncertainty} lists the major sources of systematic
uncertainty in our measurements of nuclear transparency.
The systematic uncertainty due to spectrometer acceptance was estimated by
taking the average of the bin-wise difference between the normalized missing
momentum spectra for data and simulation.

\begin{table}[htb!]
    \caption{
        Systematic uncertainties in our measurements of nuclear
        transparency.
        $Q^2$-dependent uncertainties are averaged over all kinematic settings.
        The total uncertainty is the quadrature sum of the individual
        contributions.

The uncertainty in the spectral function includes the effects of the off-shell
$\sigma_{ep}$ of 2\%, the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton (2\%)
as previously determined\,\cite{ONeill_1995}.
