    abstract = "Hadronic reactions producing strange quarks such as the exclusive p(e,e′K+)Λ and p(e,e′K+)Σ0 reactions, or the semi-inclusive p(e,e′K+)X reaction, play an important role in studies of hadron structure and the dynamics that bind the most basic elements of nuclear physics. The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach – up to the anticipated 11-GeV beam energy in Hall C – and coincidence capability with the well-understood High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS), will allow for probes of such hadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to date. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has been constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray followed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive indices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray combination will allow for identification of kaons from 1GeV/c up to 7.2GeV/c, reaching ∼10−2 proton and 10−3 pion rejection, with kaon detection efficiency better than 95%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with 14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered with Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore paper and improved the detector performance by 35%. The inner surface of the two aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper, however, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered with Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance. The measured mean number of photoelectrons in saturation is ∼12 for n=1.030, ∼8 for n=1.020, ∼10 for n=1.015, and ∼5.5 for n=1.011. The design details, the results of component characterization, and initial performance tests and optimization of the detector are presented."

author = {Cothran, C and Day, D and Mitchell, J},
abstractNote = {A 1.5 m long threshold gas Cerenkov detector has ben constructed and installed as part of the standard detector package in the Hall C High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) at CEBAF. Designed to operate over a range of pressures the detector should be able to discriminate electrons from pions with momenta up to 6.5 GeV/c with good efficiency. Two thin spherical mirrors with a radius 163 cm focus the light to two 5-inch photomultipliers and provide an active area of 110 cm{sup 2} in the dispersive plane and 55 cm{sup 2} in the transverse plane. A large photoelectron yield is promised by the good optical properties of the mirrors (coated with AlMgF for efficient UV reflection) and the UV transmission through the window of the Burle 8854 phototubes. The authors will describe the design and construction of the detector and will present the results of the early commissioning studies.},

For the existing High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) and Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS), design considerations, relevant construction information, and comparisons of simulated and experimental results are included. The energy resolution of the HMS and SOS calorimeters is better than σ/E∼6%/E and pion/electron (π/e) separation of about 100:1 has been achieved in the energy range of 1–5GeV. Good agreement has been observed between the experimental and simulated energy resolutions, but simulations systematically exceed experimentally determined π− suppression factors by close to a factor of two. For the Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS), presently under construction, details on the design and accompanying GEANT4 simulation efforts are given. The anticipated performance of the new calorimeter is predicted over the full momentum range of the SHMS. Good electron/hadron separation is anticipated by combining the energy deposited in an initial (preshower) calorimeter layer with the total energy deposited in the calorimeter."
